# STELLAR UNION
### Seasons and Episodes

Episodes run in a fixed order, unlike *Nikolai Grozny*. Each episode has multiple endings, including at least one “good” ending, and usually a “best” one, and the player will get a code to enter into the next episode, for metaplot state. A “bad” ending does not generate a code, and doesn’t allow the campaign to continue. A "hidden bad" ending *does* generate a code, and the campaign can continue, but will be harder, possibly unwinnable. A “The End” is a failure termination before the end of the episode. There will generally also be opportunities to develop one or more crew members. The difficulty of the climax of Season 3, when Player must steal the Eridanus to confront Harmony, depends on how many of the crew are leveled up to +2.

## Season 1: Command of *Eridanus*
### 101:	*That Untravelled World, Whose Margin Fades*

*Eridanus* finds the *Delphinus* adrift, her crew missing, amidst a Negative Space Wedgie that the *Eridanus* crew at first assumes to be a natural phenomenon. Presents the ship as a busybox, familiarizing the player with how it works, and there are multiple solutions depending on the crew selected for the boarding party. Getting *Delphinus* online and investigating what happened requires teamwork of boarding party, *Suspended*-style. 

- *What is the nature of the Negative Space Wedgie?* It's an improperly formed hyperspace entry. The prototype entry generator on *Delphinus* is stuck in a loop, creating nested entries inside each other, with profoundly negative consequences for the structure of spacetime in the immediate area.
- *What caused the Negative Space Wedgie?* DefCom is trying to reverse engineer the Tiberian Raptor, and pressed one of ExCom's shiny new fast scouts into service. But there are design flaws in the Union copy of the Tiberian entry device, and it isn't calibrated properly. And it's stuck on "full blast," and in an infinite loop.
- *What's the danger to* Delphinus? The circuit powering the hyperspace entry emitter is fused open, and it's draining the ship's power. When the power expires, the opening will close, leaving the *Delphinus* in hyperspace.
- *What's the danger to* Eridanus? Depends on whether they maneuver into the entry zone or not.
- *What's the danger to personnel in the transition zone?* Anyone not in an EVA suit is susceptible to the neurological effects of the broken hyper entry generator.
- *Where's the crew, and how do we get them back?* Original idea: the crew beamed themselves into the MTD anchor and/or abandoned ship. New idea: they're unconscious due to the effects of the Negative Space Wedgie. Alert, responsive crew can make the engineering solution too easy, but there need to be crew to treat for any of the life sciences people to be useful boarding party members.
- *How do we fix the ship?* Shut down the hyperspace entry generator.
- *How do we fix the Negative Space Wedgie?* Get the ships out of the entry, and shut down the generator.
- *How do we keep this from happening again?* Revive the crew and salvage the *Delphinus*.

**The End:** PC dies, or ship PC is on vanishes for good.

**Bad Ending:** PC escapes to *Eridanus*, but *Delphinus* vanishes.

**Bad Ending:** Boarding party stabilizes *Delphinus*, but *Eridanus* vanishes.

**Fair Ending:** Boarding party stabilizes *Delphinus*; *Eridanus* is fine. *Delphinus'* crew is lost.

**Good Ending:** Boarding party stabilizes *Delphinus* and rescues crew; *Eridanus* is fine.

**Best Ending:** Good ending, and actually worked out how to make entry and exit from hyperspace happen safely.

**Development Opportunities:** On good or best ending, increment the other members of the boarding party. Development is through the main plot, not a B-plot. On bad ending, decrement Kaur, Adamu, and boarding party members.

### 102:	*That Eternal Silence*

When a Regulan diplomat is found murdered aboard the *Eridanus*, Player and the crew must solve the case before it becomes an interstellar incident. Straight-up murder mystery. Lots of NPCs to converse with. Bottle show. In a B-plot, Flag Officer Kwomben is unhappy with Kalbar's role on the *Eridanus*, and will take it out on the PC if they stick up for them.

**The End:** Murderer kills PC or destroys ship.

**Bad Ending:** Murderer escapes.

**Hidden Bad Ending:** Murder pinned on wrong party; diplomatic complications ensue that derail episode 203.

**Fair Ending:** Murderer caught, but Quellan connection hidden.

**Good Ending:** Murderer caught, Quellan connection uncovered.

**Best Ending:** Good ending, and won respect of Regulans.

**Development Opportunities:** 

### 103:	*The Ringing Plains of Windy Troy*

LCR Player is court-martialled for the loss of SUS *Argo Navis*. (Faces a review board?) Flashbacks to Player attending SUS *Punisher*, and a post-solution mode for the player to just play Trek.  Gives a series of flashbacks from the courtroom to the battle, from a number of POVs. Introduces perspective switching. The battle is a hard tactical problem for the player to solve. 

NOTE: Move this later in the season? More technically demanding than 105, 106, and maybe 104. This needs to happen fairly early to be plausible; Flag Officer Kwomnu's vendetta gives a bit more wiggle room, though. Was originally 102.

**Bad Ending:** Convicted.
	
**Bad Ending:** Relieved of command.

**Fair Ending:** Letter of reprimand; wrong account is accepted, and lesson about Q8 not learned by the Fleet.

**Good Ending:** Cleared.

**Best Ending:** Cleared, and got top marks in The Punisher.

**Development Opportunity:** Maybe Kaur helps get Player cleared, and levels up for succeeding?

### 104:	*Free Hearts, Free Foreheads*

The *Eridanus* first encounters Harmony, while rescuing a refugee ship from a planet she's taken over.

Okay, so how does that play out?

Receive distress signal, and respond to it. Maybe the ship weirdly claims to be just fine now?

**Bad Ending:** Harmony takes over the ship and PC.

**Hidden Bad Ending:** Kaur is taken over by Harmony, which derails episode 204. Presents as another ending, but derails the metaplot later.

**Fair Ending:** *Eridanus* blows up the refugee ship to escape.

**Good Ending:** Refugees and *Eridanus* crew are safe.

**Best Ending:** Good ending, member of Harmony is captured for study. 

**Development Opportunities:** 

### 105: 	*Through Scudding Drifts, the Rainy Hyades*
	
An ion storm threatens the Eridanus, forcing her to seek new Energon crystals from a pre-industrial planet. Fly ship into sector; storm is unavoidable. Limp under reactionless to nearest E-class planet, and land. Proceed on foot to hunt for crystals; get caught up in medieval drama with locals. 

Include the Quellans in this? A *Friday’s Child/Private Little War/Errand of Mercy* scenario, in which the Quellans are behind the other end of the medieval drama, and Ship Leader Qavolneq is set up as the local overlord, could add to this, and make the segue to 106 smoother.

**The End:** PC dies; Eridanus doesn't survive ion storm.

**Bad Ending:** Eridanus is wrecked, but contacts Exploration Command.

**Fair Ending:** 

**Good Ending:** 

**Development Opportunities:** 

### 106:	*And Not To Yield*
	
When *Eridanus* is captured by the Quellans, LCR Player and the crew must recapture her. *Eridanus* is ambushed by a Q7 cruiser. Futile pursuit, shields blown down, boarding of damaged *Eridanus*. Player thrown in brig; crew confined in shuttle bay. Break out of brig, sneak around undetected, free enough friendlies to overpower the prize crew.

Introduces Ship Leader Qavolneq, a foil for Player over the coming seasons, unless the previous episode introduced him.

**The End:** *Eridanus* destroyed or self-destructs, or PC killed by Quellans.

**Bad Ending:** The Quellans evacuate the air from the shuttle bay and kill the crew.

**Bad Ending:** Escape Quellans in shuttle, but ship and crew still captured. (The Quellans move the shuttle to the ventral docking port to clear the bay to hold the crew.)

**Fair Ending:** Recapture the ship and warp out before the Quellans can react.

**Good Ending:** Recapture the ship, and cripple or destroy the Q7, in either order. Stealing Energon crystals from the Q7, to fuel the escape, is particularly artistic.

**Best Ending:** Incite mutiny on Q7 and capture it.

**Development opportunities:**

### 107:	*This Gray Spirit, Yearning in Desire*
	
LCR Player and the *Eridanus* must work together with CPT Stewart and the *Odysseus*, and the rest of the squadron, in confronting a giant space creature that threatens the heart of the Union.
	
**Bad Ending:**

**Good Ending:** The *Eridanus* crew saves the day, and saves the *Odysseus* crew. Player catches Stewart's eye as an officer to mentor.

**Development Opportunities:** 
	
### 108:	*There Gloom the Broad, Dark Seas* (FULL LENGTH)

The Eridanus surveys a previously uncharted quadrant, encountering a number of shorter adventures along the way. Maybe have them add up to something? Maybe not?

### 100:	*All Experience is an Arch* (FULL LENGTH, OPTIONAL)
	
In a flashback, LCR player attends the Command Fitness Course. Numbered as 100, but implemented last. Or possibly right after 102. (TBD: Do we need this? Should this be the S2 ender, with Kaur actually going through *Punisher* at the time?)
	
This is a tutorial on how to fly Union ships and play TREK very well, framed as a classroom course set at Stellar Academy. Over the course of a whole syllabus of training runs, Player mans all the bridge stations, flies and commands the ship, and eventually graduates to the shipboard portion of the course. Other students are also taking the class, and do well or poorly, and the students and instructors comment on how well each scenario was played. This is essentially a straight-up remake of TREK, for players who enjoy solving tactical problems. The course will pose quite a few interesting ones, and then the open simulator time will let the player create their own.

Episode 308 might be very difficult for a player who hasn’t completed this one.

Might hold the development and release of this one until after 208.

**The End:** Player flunks.
	
**Good Ending:** Player moves on to the shipboard portion, portrayed in *The Ringing Plains of Windy Troy.* This is presumed to have happened before episode 101, and doesn't result in changes to the campaign records.

**Development Opportunities:** none -- 101 starts the campaign, not this, and this isn't sequentially next in the chronology.
	
## Season 2: First Officer on *Odysseus*
### 201:	*He Works His Work, I Mine*

Promoted to XO of the Odysseus, CDR Player finds CPT Stewart less of a kindred spirit than expected. The first seeds of the Alliance breakaway are sown. (I'm vague about this.)
	
### 202:	TBD
	
TBD. This should be a Kaur/Eridanus episode, not a Player/Odysseus one. Or not?
	
### 203:	*To Make Mild a Rugged People*

On the heels of their success in uncovering the Regulan ambassador's murderer, CDR Player and the Odysseus are sent to negotiate an alliance with the Regulans. But who invited the Quellans?

The Quellans attack the Regulan fleet, with a fleet centered around a (previously unseen) Q9 (or Q10?), and Senior Ship Leader Qavolneq is there in a shiny new Q8. As liaison to the Regulan fleet, Player’s familiarity with the Quellans and their tricks must save the day.
	
### 204:	*Offices of Tenderness*
	
The ship's surgeon of the Eridanus must find the cure for a devastating pandemic, before it spreads beyond its planet of origin. 

Beats:

Characterize the disease
	
**The End:** 

**Bad Ending:**

**Hidden Bad Ending:** Plague cured, but not discovered to be Harmony. This is the worst possible ending, because even reviewing al-Masri’s notes isn’t going to lead to a cure in 308, leaving only the Regulans as a (very narrow) way to solve the series.

**Hidden Bad Ending:** Kaur was taken over by Harmony in episode 104, and stuns al-Masri (or his replacement), and infects him. Harmony then suppresses al-Masri's research, but it's findable in the *Eridanus* computer network in 308.

**Good Ending:** Al-Masri cures the disease, and transmits to the Union how to kill Harmony.

### 205:	*Souls That Have Toiled, and Wrought, and Thought With Me*

Harmony must take over a *Cygnus*-class vessel, and use it to spread herself across the Union and beyond. If 104 and 205 had Hidden Bad Endings, the ship is the *Eridanus*. Otherwise, it’s the *Pyxis*.
	
### 206:	*Unequal Laws to a Savage Race*

As tensions between the Union and the Quellans reach a boiling point, a false alarm orders the Exploration Fleet’s Cygnus-class fast scouts to bomb critical infrastructure within the Quellan Empire. One ship, the *Canes Venatici*, fails to heed the recall signal, and *Odysseus* and a flotilla of *Cygnus*es are ordered to intercept her. This is really a Trojan horse to enable Harmony to infect the Quellans, which the player might know from the dramatic irony of 205, but Player won’t. And of course Senior Ship Leader Qavolneq turns up at the critical moment.
	
### 207:	*Life Piled on Life*

A "Mary Sue" officer aboard the Odysseus turns out to be Harmony, and triggers an internal crisis that threatens the Union.

Okay, how might this go?

“Mary Sue” arrives on board. How does Player become suspicious of her?

### 208:	*The Long Day Wanes*

Human separatists in the Union want to break away over the handling of the Harmony crisis, and CPT Stewart is on their side. (I'm vague about this.) (Make this full length?)

## Season 3: Command of *Odysseus*

### 304:	TBD

### 306:	TBD

### 307:	*Men That Strove With Gods*

Harmony seizes control of the Union, and Player and the ride-or-die Level 2 crew must escape by stealing the *Eridanus*.
	
### 308:	*The Utmost Bound of Human Thought*

The fate of the Union hangs in the balance, in the final confrontation with Harmony. The stolen *Eridanus* is pursued by half the Union fleet, and must get away and somehow prevent Harmony from overrunning what’s left of the Union… and perhaps recover what was lost?

How do you recover from a Harmony pandemic? 

- Avoid getting captured yourself. The escape sequence in 307, the opening scene of 308, and inoculating the crew with a vaccine all make this happen. You start with two Cygnuses in pursuit (*Pyxis* and *Delphinus? Pyxis* and *Vulpecula?*), and the rest of Harmony’s lagging behind. Encounter a third *Cygnus* that isn’t Harmony-infected (*Vulpecula? Delphinus?*), and convince them that you’re uninfected before the infected pursuers can give them the idea that you’re the infected ship.
- Prevent the core of the Union from being overrun. This can be as simple as breaking away from Harmony’s fleet and getting the Union to listen, but if not done, it’ll prevent the inoculation campaign, and result in a Bad Ending.
- Find a cure. Al-Masri developed one in 204, which Harmony!Kaur would have suppressed if the Hidden Bad Ending of 104 happened. In that case, al-Masri’s notes are still in the bio lab computer on the *Eridanus*, and a xenobiology researcher with access to that lab can recreate his work. If 104 ended badly, and *Eridanus* is abandoned, the game is nearly unwinnable – somehow figuring out which planet al-Masri helped, and getting samples from their population, is necessary to recreate his work. Or somehow figuring out that the Regulans are immune.
- Administer the cure/vaccine to a large enough population to know that it works, without being intercepted by Harmony’s fleet.
- Wrestle with the moral implications of wiping out Harmony. That’s genocide, isn’t it? How do you balance the freedom of entire populations with the existence of a life form that depends on taking them over? Who gets to decide?
- Negotiate with Harmony, or wipe her out. (The latter won’t work, and will leave an enraged Harmony as a threat in any hypothetical full-length sequel games.) This is an intentionally stark choice; don’t let the player off the hook by giving them an easy out.

Success triggers a victory sequence, in which the surviving crew are reunited to depart in a refitted *Odysseus*.
	
### 309	*The Baths of All the Western Stars* (FULL LENGTH PLUS)
	
Another "sandbox" episode, but with the *Odysseus*. Not confined to a single quadrant. Lots of procedural generation, full implementation of the *Odysseus*, at least a dozen scripted miniplots on planets. Needs to move to Glulx. Getting 100% completion, after a successful playthrough of 307, triggers a "series end" sequence, after which the *Odysseus* sets out on deeper-range exploration, on a hopeful note. Throw in the discover and handling of another threat from the treat file? It's Star Control II, but it's TREK. (Is this 309, or 401?)

## Want To Fit In

- Kwom parent objects to child choosing service; Player must side one way or the other. Supporting the crewmember worsens things with the Kwom; supporting the parent worsens morale and loses the best crew performance in that billet, with the replacement being the worst.
- Kwom coup d'etat, linked to Harmony, simultaneous with outer colony unrest. Who's behind it?
- Player and Kaur end up on opposite sides of the Union/Alliance split, to put a viewpoint inside the Alliance.
- Things get worse with the Quellans (Chekov's hand weapon). They go to war with the Regulans, and the war gets worse.
- Harmony takes over the Quellans. And the Tiberians? And at least one faction in the Union-Alliance dispute.
