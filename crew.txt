SUS _Eridanus_ (SF-386)

CREW MANIFEST

Each billet has one replacement, two for billets where the incumbent
as of episode 101 is plotted to leave the ship during the first three
seasons. If no one is available for a given billet, the campaign ends
in failure, with the CO relieved for excessive crew casualties.
Replacement characters are designed to be slotted in with minimal code
and branch changes, following similar arcs with less colour.

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the inter-episode schema, each billet is marked with five bits for
the episode when the first officer became a casualty, two bits for the
officer's development (-1 to +2), and one bit for going to the second
alternate, which fits each billet in one byte. A +2 locks in the
holder as one of Player's ride-or-die companions.
