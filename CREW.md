# CREW MANIFEST
### SUS *Eridanus* (SF-386)

## GENERAL NOTES

Each billet has one replacement, two for billets where the incumbent as of episode 101 is plotted to leave the ship during the first three seasons. If no one is available for a given billet, it doesn’t get filled with replacement crew. There are four watch-standing rota: OOW, quartermaster, engineer, and science station. If any rota drops below two members, the campaign ends in failure, with the CO relieved for excessive crew casualties. Replacement characters are designed to be slotted in with minimal code and branch changes, following similar arcs, possibly with a bit with less colour. Incumbent crew start at 0 or +1; replacements generally start at -1, with exceptions.

Skills rank from 0 to 3, and default to 0. Add +1 for the skill being a departmental skill for the crewmember, +1 for the character being at +1 or +2 development, -1 for the character being at -1 development, and +1 for the skill being the character’s specialty. That makes the skill levels programmatically obvious, rather than needing a table. A handful of characters have programmed-in other modifiers. (Missy is inept at a number of things, for example.)

There are 16 skills: piloting (deck), navigation (deck), gunnery (deck), ground combat (deck, security, supply), survival (deck, security, science), MTD operation (deck, engineering), scrounging (supply), damage control (engineering, supply), sensors (deck, engineering, science), antimatter engineering (engineering), drive engineering (engineering), astrophysics (science), geology (science), linguistics (science), biology (science, medical), and medicine (medical). Every department has at least two departmental skills, and at least one that’s unique to the department.

Departments not represented aboard a ship as small as a Cygnus include Security, Tactical, and Flag. Uniform colours: Command (purple), Deck (), Supply (brown), Security (), Tactical (), Engineering (), Science (), Medical (), Flag (gold). 

### Unresolved Questions

- Three development opportunities times 15 crew means we need to find 45 slots in 10-12 episodes, which is an absolutely frantic pace. Limit the development system to department heads?
- Firm up skill list
- If second officer is Deck head, who is OOW during department head meetings? Does XO represent Deck in the meeting, while 2O takes the watch? Does Bosun take the watch?

## COMMAND CREW

### Commanding Officer

Duty station: watch 1, captain's chair, bridge (watch 1 OOW)
Battle station: captain's chair, bridge
Quarters: captain's sleeping cabin, deck 1
This billet doesn’t have a status byte, because it’s scripted.

**Incumbent:** LCR Alex Player

Service Number: 123-456-7890. Date of birth: XX/XX/XX (age xx). Species/Gender: HX (human non-binary).
Birthplace: Cambridge, North America, Earth
Traits: Is the PC. Aro ace, thereby eliminating any need to write romance subplots, and non-binary gender eliminates the need to ask (or assume) what the player's gender is. Promoted to XO of the Odysseus at the end of season 1, leaving Kaur in command.
No GDW-style cards for character traits, because PC.

**Scripted replacement:** SLT/CND/LCR Amrit Kaur (see below)

No second replacement; Kaur has Main Character Immunity, and you get a Bad Ending if that’s violated.

### Executive Officer 

Duty station: watch 2, captain's chair, bridge (watch 2 OOW)
Battle station: auxiliary control station, computer core
Quarters: XO's cabin, deck 2

**Incumbent:** SLT Amrit Kaur 

Service Number: 123-456-7890. Date of birth: XX/XX/XX (age: yy). Species/Gender: HF (human female).
Birthplace: Amritpur, New Khalistan
Traits: Observant Khalsa Sikh, and too religious to get into any romance arc (or already has a partner off-ship?), which spares us from writing any if she takes over as CO. Has a very strong working relationship with Player; more cool with Zhou once she takes over. Is selected as a command candidate after the first successful playable mission of season 2, goes off to Punisher late in season 2, and makes LCR by the start of season 3.

**Scripted replacement:** SLT Zhou Xiaoping

Service Number: 123-456-7890. Date of birth: XX/XX/XX (age: yy). Species/Gender: HM (human male).

Traits: 

**Second replacement** (for loss after Kaur promoted): SLT NFN Suparman

## SUPPLY DEPARTMENT

### Steward/Supercargo (reports to Second Officer)

Duty station: idler, duties throughout ship
Battle station: deck 1 DC locker
Quarters: port (deck) crew quarters, deck 3

**Incumbent:** LC Kwomben Galbar

Service Number: 123-456-7890. Date of birth: XX/XX/XX (age: yy). Species/Gender: KX (Kwom, undeclared).
Birthplace: 
Traits: Is the sixth in line of succession for Supreme Archon of Kwomnu, but is temperamentally unsuited for the position. The Kwomben family has been all Path of Leadership for six generations, without even a Renouncer, and Galbar’s heartparent (a “Defence Mafia” admiral) is horrified to see their child in the enlisted ranks, not on a trajectory for the Academy, and still Undeclared, leaning toward Service. (Bodyparent is more sympathetic, but the family has expectations.) A whole subplot breaks out when it comes out that they’re s-type, not M-type (the Kwom are all M/s), and the admiral threatens to yank them home. 
Starts at level +1, and pins at level +2 if Player successfully defends them. 
Gender marker changes to “KS” after Player defends them. (For the Kwom, L, R, S, and X are all non-binary; non-Kwom don’t generally understand the distinction between them. Was there a KH also?)
If Galbar is KIA, their family will come hard after Player, and try to get them relieved.
Is by FAR the most competent holder for this billet; replacement #1 is pretty much the worst.

**Scripted replacement:** OC Melissa "Missy" Van Dusen

Service Number: 123-456-7890. Date of birth: XX/XX/XX (age: yy). Species/Gender: HF.
Birthplace: Mamaroneck, North America, Earth
Traits: From a wealthy family, and has coasted on family connections until she joined Stellar Command. Is expecting to be selected for the Academy, but is *far* from being on track for it, and her parents are less influential with ExCom than they are with figures on Earth. This is her first assignment, and she considers the Supply Department beneath her; she'll "phone it in" if not closely managed.

**Second replacement** (if Missy is lost after Galbar is recalled): AC Shi Zhenghong

Service Number: 123-456-7890. Date of birth: XX/XX/XX (age: yy). Species/Gender: HM.
