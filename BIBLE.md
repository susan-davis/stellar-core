# *Stellar Union* series bible

The *Stellar Union* universe is an optimistic, handwave-y future history inspired by *Star Trek*, *Galaxy Quest*, *The Orville*,  the classic mainframe `STARTREK` game from the 1970s, the 8-bit microcomputer *Star Fleet* series of games, the Infocom classic games *Planetfall* and *Stationfall*, and similar fare. Intrepid, multicultural explorers from Earth (with a few token aliens sprinkled in the crew to make the cast seem more diverse) boldly go where angels fear to tread, bringing the hegemonic values of the civilized Union to the backward natives of primitive worlds and barbaric empires, while paternalistically declining to "meddle" in their affairs "for their own good."
