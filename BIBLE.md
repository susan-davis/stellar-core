# *Stellar Union* series bible

The *Stellar Union* universe is an optimistic future history inspired
by *Star Trek*, *Galaxy Quest*, *The Orville*,  the classic mainframe
`STARTREK` game from the 1970s, the 8-bit microcomputer *Star Fleet*
series of games, the Infocom classic games *Planetfall* and
*Stationfall*, and similar fare. Intrepid, multicultural explorers
from Earth (with a few token aliens sprinkled in the crew to make the
cast seem more diverse) boldly go where angels fear to tread, bringing
the hegemonic values of the civilized Union to the backward natives of
primitive worlds and barbaric empires, while paternalistically
declining to "meddle" in their affairs "for their own good."

## General Principles

*Stellar Union* is played in a series of "competition length" (2-hour 
or so) interactive fiction adventures. The game is parser-based, but
could be adapted to choice or hybride on mobile if there's a business
opportunity there. Three "seasons" of about eight adventures each  are
planned, with an over-arching series metaplot, and at least two
"full-length" (10+ hour) sandbox-style adventures, where the player's
ship has a sector (or more!) to explore, and encounters a number of
mini-adventures along the way.

Unlike *Nikolai Grozny*, the series is linear -- episode 101 always
leads to episode 102, and so forth.

Each episode has multiple endings, which can be terminal (the series
won't progress further if reached), bad, fair, good, or best. Reaching
a bad or fair ending is generally Polite on the Zarf scale; getting to
a good ending may be Tough. The best ending and the series metaplot
are both Cruel, and it's possible to ruin a playthrough of the series
during season 1.

### Series Plot and Inter-Game Communication

#### Campaign State Schema

## The *Stellar Union* Universe

*Stellar Union* takes place in the 2270s. Earth has formed a Stellar
Union of Earth, its colonies, and several alien races.  

### Technology
Technology in the 2270s follows all the tropes of the source material,
taking a cheerfully handwave-y attitude to science fiction.   

#### Starship Technology
Warp-powered starships, with decks parallel to the direction of
travel, ply the ocean of space, but always seem to be aligned on a
common up and down direction when they meet. Ships are powered by
Applied Phlebotinum ("Energon crystals"), and attack and defend with
beams ("energy projectors")  and fields of energy ("shields"). Ships
have energy projectors, an assortment of missiles and torpedoes,
deflector shields, and warp ("Alcubierre") and impulse ("reaction")
engines. Ships are equipped with tractor beams, transporters ("matter
transport device"), and shuttlecraft.  

#### Personal Technology
Typical items available for PCs from ship's stores include:

- Uniform
- Comm
- Comm Repeater
- Multiscanner
- Stunner
- Laser Cutter
- Medical Kit
- Repair Kit
- Survival Kit
- Environment Suit
- EVA Pack
- Maneuvering Pack
- Portable Shelter
- MTD Anchor

More militaristic gear, such as handheld energy projectors and energy
pavises, is generally restricted to Patrol Command or Defence Command
missions, or to invasion scenarios. Unless a ground combat war story
is the point of the episode, omit these from your game.

## Major Powers
### The Stellar Union
The Stellar Union is idealistic and utopian 

#### Earth
#### Outlying Human Colonies
#### The Galdorites

The Galdorites are one of the founding members of the Union, and
Earth's oldest allies. They are humanoid 

#### The Kwom
#### The Generons

### The Quellan Empire
The Quellans are an expansionist empire of Proud Warrior Race
Guys. The Quellan Empire is the Stellar Union's chief rival in the
region where the series takes place. Quellan society is tribal, and
still organized around the social structures of nomadic tribal life on
Quell f, the Quellan homeworld.

The Quellans are strongly religious, and have an honour culture based
on family and tribal loyalty bonds. The Empire, an authoritarian to
totalitarian social structure that arose 

#### Quellan Ranks
The Quellan rank system spans both military and civil society. Indeed, the
concept of a strict division between the two is foreign to Quellan culture.

- Rank 1: Warrior, Herder, Healer, Smith, Hand Weapon
- Rank 2: Leader, Herd Keeper, Ear
- Rank 3: Raid Leader, Crew Leader, Eye
- Rank 4: Battle Leader, Ship Leader, Tribe Leader, Fortress Keeper, Hand
- Rank 5: War Leader, Horde Leader, Mouth
- Rank 6: reserved for members of the Imperial Family

The Quellans lack the distinction between "enlisted" and "officer"
found in other major powers. Rank 1 could be said to roughly
correspond to the responsibilities of junior enlisted, rank 2 to NCOs,
rank 3 to junior officers, and so forth, but there is no barrier to
advancement from rank 2 to rank 3, and no separate recruiting pipeline
that moves trainees from a cadet status to rank 3. 

Quellan ranks are divided into sub-ranks, each with its own
modifier prefix. Sub-rank 1 takes the prefix "Second", sub-rank 2
takes no prefix, sub-rank 3 takes the prefix "Senior", and sub-rank
4 takes the prefix "Grand." ("Second Supreme" and "Supreme" are
sub-ranks 5 and 6 respectively, but are restricted in the number of
Quellans who can hold that sub-rank.) Generally, the "Second" sub-rank
is used for second-in-command figures at each command level, and for
trainees earmarked to take on a new position, with "Second Warrior"
being the Quellan term for a cadet or recruit. Young Quellans of
pre-military age are referred to as "Third Warrior" or the equivalent
on ceremonial occasions.

Sub-ranks have a second function: they qualify Quellans for membership
in the Senior Council, Grand Council, and Supreme Council,
respectively. These councils advise senior leadership at various
levels of the empire, and confer additional social status. Promotion
to "Second" of a higher rank requires a Quellan to forgo their council
membership earned from their lower rank, and many Quellans decline
promotion for this reason. That has the effect of creating a whole
stratum of Grand Warriors and Grand Leaders in the Quellan military,
equivalent to long-service career NCOs from other galactic powers.

"Hand Weapon," "Ear," "Eye," "Hand," and "Mouth" are special religious
ranks, whose holders act in both religious and police functions. The
ranks always refer to a specific Quellan deity, generally either
Quelil or Gronkadonk, but occasionally to a minor deity. (TBD: is Eye
R3 and Hand R4, or is it the other way around?)

#### Quellan Ships
- *Q1*-class attack ship ("Attack I")
- *Q2*-class scout ("Ambush I")
- *Q3*-class attack ship ("Attack II")
- *Q4*-class cruiser ("Victory I")
- *Q5*-class invasion transport ("Conquest")
- *Q6*-class cruiser ("Victory II")
- *Q7*-class cruiser ("Victory III")
- *Q8*-class battlecruiser ("Vengeance")
- *Q10*-class pocket battleship ("Glory")
- *Q11*-class attack ship ("Attack III")
- *Q12*-class scout ("Ambush II")
- *Q13*-class battleship ("Emperor")

The Union has detected only up to Q8 at the start of the series, with
Player's encounter with Q8 #1 the Union's first encounter with that
class. Later vessels are new construction with improved technology
from Quellan espionage efforts, and will be introduced piecemeal as
the series progresses. Early Q8s were designed "for but not with"
Tiberian-style cloaking; when the whole class has them installed, it
comes as a complete surprise to the Union. Current Union tatical
doctrine was developed with knowledge only up to the Q6, and hasn't
had significant update for the Q7.

### The Regulan Matriarchy
The Regulans are bipedal carnivores hostile to the Quellans. The Union
has fought a number of skirmishes with the Regulans, but relations
between the powers have calmed in recent years, with both sides
recognizing the threat that

- *R2*-class fast scout
- *R3*-class strike cruiser
- *R4*-class transport

- *R7*-class long-range armed shuttle
- *R8*-class escort cruiser
- *R9*-class space control ship

- *R11*-class escort carrier
- *R12*-class light transport
- *R13*-class frigate
- *R14*-class cruiser
- *R15*-class transport
- *R16*-class scout

The Union has detected only up to R4 as of the start of the
series. Episode 203 introduces the Union to R5 through R10. R10 and
R11 are variants of the R4. Unlike the Quellans, the ships that the
Union knows about are the current top-of-the-line models deployed in
front-line service. R13 through R16 are older ships held in mothballs
or assigned to patrol duties in quiet areas, and the Union won't learn
of them until the Q-R war gets serious enough to require the Regulans
to mobilize them. R16 doubles as a patrol cutter, and is still
deployed in large numbers. R10 doubles as an underway replenishment
ship, "mines" being missiles deployed in loiter mode. R2 inspired the
Union's *Cygnus*-class fast scouts.

The '0' ranks in each group are temporary ranks assigned to trainees, except
Fleet Captain, which becomes permanent (and terminal) for selectees who don't
progress to Flag Officer. Flag Captain is also frequently awarded at
retirement for distinguished Captains who weren't selected for flag rank.

The '4' ranks are unique advisors to the Admiralty, representing different
constituent groups of fleet personnel. Except for the Admiral of the Fleet,
they are also temporary, for the duration of the holder's assignment to the
post, though they're restored at retirement as a courtesy if the holder
hasn't been promoted further, and past holders continue to draw the higher
pay until they are promoted. The Flag Lieutenant and Flagship Captain serve
as aides-de-camp to the Admiral of the Fleet.

### Uniform

Lorem ipsum, dolor sit facet, adipiscing consectetuer elit.

### Organization

Stellar Command is the Stellar Union's 

#### Exploration Command

Exploration Command is responsible for the exploration of space both
within and beyond the boundaries of Union space.

Exploration Command vessels are organized into Exploration Squadrons,
which perform exploration missions at the edge of Union space, and
type-specific squadrons to which ships are assigned during refits,
when working up, and when on reserve duty. Ships rotate in and out of
Exploration Squadrons 

#### Patrol Command
#### Planetary Command
#### Defence Command

The Stellar Union prides itself on not keeping a standing fleet of
warships mobilized in peacetime. In peacetime, Defence Command
consists of a Defence Staff and a Defence College, both located at
Stellar Command Headquarters. In time of war, key officers from the
three other commands would be mobilized to take command of Defence
Command, which would then command the Union's entire fleet. This has
occurred three times in Union history, during conflicts against the
Quellans, the Tiberians, and the Kwom.

In practice, Defence Command has greater influence over the culture
and procurement of the Union fleet than Stellar Command lets on. The
*Cygnus*-class fast scout (originally a torpedo boat design) becoming
the new Exploration Command standard, the high procurement levels of
the *Eratosthanes*-classfleet tug and its monitor pod, and the attempt
to pass off the *Union*-class battleship as a "new technology
destroyer" are all initiatives of the "Defence mafia," consisting
mostly of officers from the outlying human colonies, and the Kwom. A
critical mass of these officers occupy teaching positions at Stellar
Academy, and influence the careers of new junior officers, ensuring a
steady stream of new recruits.

### Ship Classes
#### *Gagarin*-class Scout (SC)

The *Gagarin* class Scout was the mainstay of the Exploration Fleet,
and of the UN Space Probe Agency before it, during the founding years
of the Union. All ships of the class have been long since retired,
with three preserved as museum ships. About two dozen decommissioned
scouts of the class, sold into civilian service, still soldier on as
tramp light freighters and yachts. (And in at least one case, as a
pirate ship.)

A visit from a *Gagarin* to an alien planet a century or more ago
could serve as the seed for a "clean up the previous explorers' mess"
plot, with the wreckage of one optionally sprinkled on a mountainside
for flavour.

A human design that predates the formation of the Stellar Union, the
*Gagarin* class set the general pattern for Union scout ships: a
lenticular hull with two Alcubierre drive emitter nacelles, and
reactionless drives at the aft end of the main hull. Crude-looking by
modern standards, the *Gagarin*'s hull is more disc-like than
lenticular, but the ship is still recognizable as a Union ship.

#### *Genbu*-class Scout (SC)

The previous class of Union scout ship was the *Genbu* class, and it
is stil by far the most numerous. Compared with the newer *Cygnus*
class, the *Genbu* is slower, sturdier, and smaller in tonnage but
larger in usable internal volume. The lenticular main hull is
stretched into an oval shape, below which are attached two rectangular
Alcubierre drive emitters. The total crew complement is more than
double that of the later *Cygnus* class, with much more generous lab
space, and a larger shuttle bay.

The *Genbu* class has earned the nickname "the Turtle," which is a pun
on the class name, an observation about the oval shape of the ship's
hull, an appreciation of the sturdy construction of the ship,  and a
derisive description of the ship's performance. With undersized
reactionless drives and an Alcubierre drive optimized for reliability
rather than performance, early ships in the class, especially the
eight vessels in Block I, were noted for their slow speed and awkward
handling both above and below lightspeed. Later models added
supplementary reactionless drive boosters to the aft ends of the
Alcubierre drive nacelles, but the ship's reputation was long since
made. 

The *Genbu* class is rapidly being supplanted by the newer *Cygnus*
class in front-line exploration service, but not enough newer fast
scouts have been constructed yet, and most exploration squadrons still
contain at least one older *Genbu*.

#### *Glidwarg*-class Destroyer (DD)

Informally known as the *Adjective* class, the *Glidwarg*-class
Destroyer is currently the only pure combat ship fielded by the
Stellar Union. 

#### *Excalibur*-class Light Cruiser (CL)

Only a single example of the *Excalibur*-class light cruiser has been
constructed, as a proof of concept of the design. The ship is a
lightly modified version of the *Eratosthanes*-class fleet tug, with a
permanently installed "Atlatl" torpedo pod installed in place of the
tug's pod grapple.
