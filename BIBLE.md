# *Stellar Union* series bible

The *Stellar Union* universe is an optimistic future history inspired by *Star Trek*, *Galaxy Quest*, *The Orville*,  the classic mainframe `STARTREK` game from the 1970s, the 8-bit microcomputer *Star Fleet* series of games, the Infocom classic games *Planetfall* and *Stationfall*, and similar fare. Intrepid, multicultural explorers from Earth (with a few token aliens sprinkled in the crew to make the cast seem more diverse) boldly go where angels fear to tread, bringing the hegemonic values of the civilized Union to the backward natives of primitive worlds and barbaric empires, while paternalistically declining to "meddle" in their affairs "for their own good."

## The *Stellar Union* Universe

*Stellar Union* takes place in the 2270s. Earth has formed a Stellar Union of Earth, its colonies, and several alien races. 

### Technology
Technology in the 2270s follows all the tropes of the source material, taking a cheerfully handwave-y attitude to science fiction.  

#### Starship Technology
Warp-powered starships, with decks parallel to the direction of travel, ply the ocean of space, but always seem to be aligned on a common up and down direction when they meet. Ships are powered by Applied Phlebotinum ("Energon crystals"), and attack and defend with beams and fields of energy. Ships have energy projectors, an assortment of missiles and torpedoes, deflector shields, and warp ("Alcubierre") and impulse ("reaction") engines. Ships are equipped with tractor beams, transporters ("matter transport beams"), and shuttlecraft.
