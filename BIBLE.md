# *Stellar Union* series bible

*Our galaxy is an endless ocean of stars. Plying that ocean are the
ships of the* Stellar Union. *Their mandate:*

- *Keep the peace among the stars.*
- *Explore the galaxy and its many planets.*
- *Follow knowledge like a sinking star, beyond the utmost bound of intelligent thought.*

*Upholding that mandate is the starship* Eridanus, *on a three-year voyage of discovery.*

The *Stellar Union* universe is an optimistic future history inspired by *Star Trek*, *Galaxy Quest*, *The Orville*, the classic mainframe`STARTREK` game from the 1970s, the 8-bit microcomputer *Star Fleet* series of games, the Infocom classic games *Planetfall* and *Stationfall*, and similar fare. Intrepid, multicultural explorers from Earth (with a few token aliens sprinkled in the crew to make the cast seem more diverse) boldly go where angels fear to tread, bringing
the hegemonic values of the civilized Union to the backward natives of primitive worlds and barbaric empires, while paternalistically declining to "meddle" in their affairs "for their own good."

## General Principles

*Stellar Union* is played in a series of "competition length" (2-hour or so) interactive fiction adventures. The game is parser-based, but could be adapted to choice or hybrid on mobile if there's a business opportunity there. Three "seasons" of about eight adventures each  are planned, with an over-arching series metaplot, and at least two "full-length" (10+ hour) sandbox-style adventures, where the player's ship has a sector (or more!) to explore, and encounters a number of mini-adventures along the way.

Unlike *Nikolai Grozny*, the series is linear -- episode 101 always leads to episode 102, and so forth.

Each episode has multiple endings, which can be terminal (the series won't progress further if reached), bad, fair, good, or best. Reaching a fair ending is generally Polite on the Zarf scale; getting to a good ending may be Tough. The best ending and the series metaplot are both Cruel, and it's possible to ruin a playthrough of the series during season 1. 

### Series Plot and Inter-Game Communication

#### Campaign State Schema

## The *Stellar Union* Universe

*Stellar Union* takes place in the 2270s. Earth is part of the Stellar Union, which comprises Earth, its colonies, and several alien species. The Stellar Union implements the "fully automated luxury space communism" trope that *Star Trek*, *The Orville*, and similar shows indulge in.

### Technology

Technology in the 2270s follows all the tropes of the source material, taking a cheerfully handwave-y attitude to science fiction. 

#### Starship Technology

Warp-powered starships, with decks parallel to the direction of travel, ply the ocean of space, but always seem to be aligned on a common up and down direction when they meet. Ships are powered by Applied Phlebotinum ("Energon crystals"), and attack and defend with beams ("energy projectors") and fields of energy ("shields"). Ships are propelled by  warp ("Alcubierre") and impulse  "reactionless") engines. Ships are equipped with tractor beams, transporters ("matter transport device"), and shuttlecraft.  

#### Personal Technology

Typical items available for PCs from ship's stores include:

- The Stellar Union uniform, which functions as a pressure suit. Pressure gloves are always provided, and the uniform has a special easy access pocket for them.
- Comm, built into the uniform. Orbital range, plus or minus what the plot demands.
- Multiscanner, useful for providing basic scans of objects and the nearby environment, as well as access to the ship's library (and the game's help system). Multiscanner functions need to be not so useful that they derail essential mysteries. Issued to scientific and medical personnel on scientific excursions away from the ship.
- Stunner, generally issued to personnel leaving the ship in wild environments, and when intruders or boarders are suspected. 
- Pressure Helmet, with built-in short-term oxygen supply. Turns any uniform into a spacesuit, and builds in an urgency clock to move the PC onward.
- EVA pack, with long-term oxygen supply. A functioning EVA pack should let the PC not worry about survival away from the ship.
- Maneuvering Pack, with medium-term oxygen supply, and zero-g thrusters. Enables spacewalk scenes. The range should be short enough to make the PC uncomfortable, except in controlled environments such as the interior of a starbase.
- Repair Kit, full of items useful for engineering personnel to effect repairs to damaged systems and areas. Heavier tools, such as laser cutters and plasma welders, should be issued sparingly, and should fail quickly.
- Medical Kit
- Survival Kit
- Portable Shelter
- MTD Anchor, which allows other MTD stations to lock on and transport  people and items from its location. It's a big heavy thing that takes a person's place on the MTD pad. Transporting down to a planet involves scanning carefully for a place to set down the MTD anchor, transporting down the anchor, and then sending any personnel. Transport can be initiated from the anchor to any station within range. The anchor is transported back aboard before the ship leaves the vicinity, except in case of emergency. There is an alcove in the MTD compartment for stowage of the anchor when the ship is underway, and usually at least two backup anchors aboard. A shortage of anchors can be used as a plot point.

More militaristic gear, such as handheld energy projectors and energy pavises (portable shields), is generally restricted to Patrol Command or Defence Command missions, or to invasion scenarios. Unless a ground combat war story is the point of the episode, omit these from your game.

## Major Powers
### The Stellar Union

The Stellar Union is idealistic and utopian in principle, but with some messy internal politics beneath the surface. An unacknowledged internal rift that no one will confront will trigger a crisis late in season 2, leading to the Alliance splitting off.

#### Earth

Earth and its nearby colonies 

#### Outlying Human Colonies

Outlying human colonies 

#### The Galdorites

The Galdorites are one of the founding members of the Union, and Earth's oldest allies. Galdorite culture strongly values scientific 

Galdorites are bipedal humanoids, with three sexes: producer, bearer, and nurturer. Pronouns are usually he/him, she/her, and they/them, but there's variation. All three sexes must cooperate for successful reproduction. 

#### The Kwom

The Kwom are 

#### The Generons

### The Quellan Empire
The Quellans are an expansionist empire of Proud Warrior Race Guys. The Quellan Empire is the Stellar Union's chief rival in the region where the series takes place. Quellan society is tribal, and still organized around the social structures of nomadic tribal life on Quell f, the Quellan homeworld.

The Quellans are strongly religious, and have an honour culture based on family and tribal loyalty bonds. The Empire, an authoritarian to totalitarian social structure that arose 

#### Quellan Ranks
The Quellan rank system spans both military and civil society. Indeed, the concept of a strict division between the two is foreign to Quellan culture.

- Rank 1: Warrior, Herder, Healer, Smith, Hand Weapon
- Rank 2: Leader, Herd Keeper, Ear
- Rank 3: Raid Leader, Crew Leader, Eye
- Rank 4: Battle Leader, Ship Leader, Tribe Leader, Fortress Keeper, Hand
- Rank 5: War Leader, Horde Leader, Mouth
- Rank 6: reserved for members of the Imperial Family

The Quellans lack the distinction between "enlisted" and "officer" found in human military organizations. Rank 1 could be said to roughly correspond to the responsibilities of junior enlisted, rank 2 to NCOs, rank 3 to junior officers, and so forth, but there is no barrier to advancement from rank 2 to rank 3, and no separate recruiting pipeline that moves trainees from a cadet status to rank 3. 

Quellan ranks are divided into sub-ranks, each with its own
modifier prefix. Sub-rank 1 takes the prefix "Second", sub-rank 2 takes no prefix, sub-rank 3 takes the prefix "Senior", and sub-rank 4 takes the prefix "Grand." ("Second Supreme" and "Supreme" are sub-ranks 5 and 6 respectively, but are restricted in the number of Quellans who can hold that sub-rank.) There is also a training sub-rank 0, which takes the prefix "Third." Generally, the "Second" sub-rank is used for second-in-command figures at each command level, and is the entry level rank for individual contributors at each level.

Sub-ranks have a second function: they qualify Quellans for membership in the Senior Council, Grand Council, and Supreme Council, respectively. These councils advise senior leadership at various levels of the empire, and confer additional social status. Promotion to "Second" of a higher rank requires a Quellan to forgo their council membership earned from their lower rank, and many Quellans decline promotion for this reason. That has the effect of creating a whole stratum of Grand Warriors and Grand Leaders in the Quellan military, equivalent to long-service career NCOs from other galactic powers.

"Hand Weapon," "Ear," "Eye," "Hand," and "Mouth" are special religious ranks, whose holders act in both religious and police functions. The ranks always refer to a specific Quellan deity, generally either Quelil or Qvortalan, but occasionally to a minor deity, or a mythological hero such as Gronkadonk. (TBD: is Eye R3 and Hand R4, or is it the other
way around?)

Quellans are trained from birth into the Quellan rank system, and young Quellans of pre-military age are given the rank "Third Warrior" or "Third Herder," depending on social status, gender, and parents' occupation. Some young Quellans move back and forth between categories, for reasons more complex than is worth going into unless you're writing a game with Quellan protagonists. The equivalent of basic training takes place during childhood and secondary education, which solidifies the category the Quellan will progress in. (Additional "Third" ranks become available during this training; for example, a devout young Quellan might be trained as a Third Hand Weapon of their deity.) At the age of majority, a Quellan is promoted to Second Warrior/Herder/whatnot, and posted to an assignment, with a promotion to the second sub-rank automatic one Quellan year later, except in cases of serious incompetence. Quellans can be demoted to Second Warrior, or the equivalent, as punishment, but no adult Quellan is ever "Third" at rank 0. Quellan society expects that both members of a couple will hold down equally responsible positions, and it is considered a mark of shame if one does not. "Your spouse is a Second Herder" is a fairly serious Quellan insult.

#### Quellan Ships
- *Q1*-class attack ship ("Attack I")
- *Q2*-class scout ("Ambush I")
- *Q3*-class attack ship ("Attack II")
- *Q4*-class cruiser ("Victory I")
- *Q5*-class invasion transport ("Conquest")
- *Q6*-class cruiser ("Victory II")
- *Q7*-class cruiser ("Victory III")
- *Q8*-class battlecruiser ("Vengeance")
- *Q10*-class pocket battleship ("Glory")
- *Q11*-class attack ship ("Attack III")
- *Q12*-class scout ("Ambush II")
- *Q13*-class battleship ("Emperor")

The Union has detected only up to Q8 at the start of the series, with Player's encounter with Q8 #1 the Union's first encounter with that class. Later vessels are new construction with improved technology from Quellan espionage efforts, and will be introduced piecemeal as the series progresses. Early Q8s were designed "for but not with" Tiberian-style cloaking; when the whole class has them installed, it comes as a complete surprise to the Union. Current Union tatical doctrine was developed with knowledge only up to the Q6, and hasn't had significant update for the Q7. 

### The Tiberian Public Sector
The Tiberians occupy space fairly far from the Quellan and Regulan frontiers, and 

#### Tiberian Ranks

#### Tiberian Ships

### The Regulan Matriarchy
The Regulans are bipedal carnivores hostile to the Quellans. The Union has fought a number of skirmishes with the Regulans, but relations between the powers have calmed in recent years, with both sides recognizing the threat that Quellan technological progress poses.

#### Regulan Ranks

#### Regulan Ships
- *R1*-class missile frigate
- *R2*-class fast scout
- *R3*-class strike cruiser
- *R4*-class transport
- *R5*-class long-range armed shuttle
- *R6*-class destroyer escort
- *R7*-class escort cruiser
- *R8*-class arsenal ship
- *R9*-class space control ship
- *R10*-class minelayer
- *R11*-class escort carrier
- *R12*-class light transport
- *R13*-class frigate
- *R14*-class cruiser
- *R15*-class transport
- *R16*-class scout
- *R17*-class Q-ship
- *R18*-class long-range armed shuttle
- *R19*-class Q-ship

The Union has detected only up to R4 as of the start of the
series. Episode 203 introduces the Union to R5 through R9. R10 and R11 are variants of the R4. R7 is a variant of the R3. R17 is a variant of the R15. R19 is a variant of the R12. 

Unlike the Quellans, the ships that the Union knows about are the current top-of-the-line models deployed in front-line service. R13 through R16 are older ships held in mothballs or assigned to patrol duties in quiet areas, and the Union won't learn of them until the Q-R war gets serious enough to require the Regulans to mobilize them. R16 doubles as a patrol cutter,and is still deployed in large numbers. R10 doubles as an underway replenishment ship, "mines" being missiles deployed in loiter mode. R2
inspired the Union's *Cygnus*-class fast scouts. R17 through R19 are new developments during the Q-R war.  

## New Threats
### Harmony
Harmony is the Big Bad of the series (or of at least the initial three seasons, if *SU* runs longer). They are a parasitic hive mind that takes over intelligent beings, erasing and subsuming their original personality.  Harmony lets us have a zombie apocalypse story, but also have a charismatic villain who shows up repeatedly to challenge and taunt the PC.

### The Alliance of Independent Worlds

Earth's outlying colonies and the Kwom both split off from the Union at the end of season 2. Stellar Command's Defence Command breaks away with them, being staffed largely by human colonists and Kwom. A conspiracy to do precisely this is later revealed to have been in the works for years, including secret light cruiser and dreadnought production.

### The Tarantulans

### The Grey Goo

## Minor Powers
### Minor Interstellar Powers

### Sublight Worlds

## Stellar Command
### Ranks

Stellar Command ranks  reflect a mixture of human, Galdorite, and Kwom tradition.

- E0: Recruit (REC)
- E1: Crewmember (OC)
- E2: Able Crewmember (AC)
- E3: Leading Crewmember (LC)
- E4: Chief Crewmember of the Fleet (CCF) (one per fleet)
- E5: Cheif Crewmember of the Union (CCU) (unique)
- W0: Cadet (CDT)
- W1: Warrant Officer (WO)
- W2: Chief Warrant Officer (CWO)
- W3: Master Chief Warrant Officer (MC)
- W4: Master Chief Warrant Officer of the Fleet (MCF) (one per fleet)
- W5: Master Chief Warrant Officer of the Union (MCU) (unique)
- J0: Midshipman (MS)
- J1: Ensign (ENS)
- J2: Lieutenant (LT)
- J3: Senior Lieutenant (SLT)
- J4: Flag Lieutenant (FL) (one per fleet)
- J5: Flag Lieutenant of the Union (FLU) (unique)
- C0: Command Candidate (CND)
- C1: Lieutenant Commander (LCR)
- C2: Commander (CDR)
- C3: Captain (CPT)
- C4: Flagship Captain (FSC) (one per fleet)
- C4: Flagship Captain of the Union (FCU) (unique)
- F0: Fleet Captain (FC)
- F1: Commodore (COM)
- F2: Flag Officer (FO)
- F3: Admiral (ADM)
- F4: Fleet Admiral (FA) (one per fleet)
- F5: Admiral of the Union Fleet (FAU) (unique)

The '0' ranks in each group are temporary ranks assigned to trainees, except Fleet Captain, which becomes permanent (and terminal) for selectees who don't progress to Flag Officer. Flag Captain is also frequently awarded at retirement for distinguished Captains who weren't selected for flag rank.

The '4' ranks are unique advisors to the Admiralty, representing different constituent groups of fleet personnel. Except for the Admiral of the Fleet, they are also temporary, for the duration of the holder's assignment to the post, though they're restored at retirement as a courtesy if the holder hasn't been promoted further, and past holders continue to draw the higher pay until they are promoted. The Flag Lieutenant and Flagship Captain serve as aides-de-camp to the Admiral of the Fleet.

### Uniform

Lorem ipsum, dolor sit facet, adipiscing consectetuer elit.

### Organization

Stellar Command is the Stellar Union's 

#### Exploration Command

Exploration Command ("ExCom") is responsible for the exploration of space both within and beyond the boundaries of Union space.

Exploration Command vessels are organized into Exploration Squadrons, which perform exploration missions at the edge of Union space, and type-specific squadrons to which ships are assigned during refits, when working up, and when on reserve duty. Ships rotate in and out of Exploration Squadrons 

#### Patrol Command
#### Planetary Command

Planetary Command ("PlanCom") manages the Union's starbases, outposts, and planetary installations. 

#### Defence Command

The Stellar Union prides itself on not keeping a standing fleet of warships mobilized in peacetime. In peacetime, Defence Command ("DefCom") consists of a Defence Staff and a Defence College, both located at Stellar Command Headquarters. In time of war, key officers from the three other commands would be mobilized to take command of Defence Command, which would then command the Union's entire fleet. This has occurred three times in Union history, during conflicts against the Quellans, the Tiberians, and the Kwom.

In practice, Defence Command has greater influence over the culture and procurement of the Union fleet than Stellar Command lets on. The *Cygnus*-class fast scout (originally a torpedo boat design) becoming the new Exploration Command standard, the high procurement levels of the *Eratosthanes*-classfleet tug and its monitor pod, and the attempt to pass off the *Union*-class battleship as a "new technology destroyer" are all initiatives of the "Defence mafia," consisting mostly of officers from the outlying human colonies, and the Kwom. A critical mass of these officers occupy teaching positions at Stellar Academy, and influence the careers of new junior officers, ensuring a steady stream of new recruits.

### Ship Classes
#### *Gagarin*-class Scout (SC)

The *Gagarin* class Scout was the mainstay of the Exploration Fleet, and of the UN Space Probe Agency before it, during the founding years of the Union. All ships of the class have been long since retired, with three preserved as museum ships. About two dozen decommissioned scouts of the class, sold into civilian service, still soldier on as tramp light freighters and yachts. (And in at least one case, as a pirate ship.)

A visit from a *Gagarin* to an alien planet a century or more ago could serve as the seed for a "clean up the previous explorers' mess" plot, with the wreckage of one optionally sprinkled on a mountainside for flavour.

A human design that predates the formation of the Stellar Union, the *Gagarin* class set the general pattern for Union scout ships: a lenticular hull with two Alcubierre drive emitter nacelles, and reactionless drives at the aft end of the main hull. Crude-looking by modern standards, the *Gagarin*'s hull is more disc-like than lenticular, but the ship is still recognizable as a Union ship.

#### *Kwompar*-class Scout (SC)

The *Kwompar* class, built by Kwom shipyards, continues to be produced in limited numbers, despite being outclassed by the later *Genbu* and *Cygnus* classes. The design features the elongated "horseshoe crab" hull common in Kwom designs, with a distinctive single A-drive pod mounted above. The *Kwompar* focuses on sensors and probes, at the expense of onboard lab space. The class is frequently used for odd jobs, and serves with Exploration Command, Patrol Command, and Planetary Command.

#### *Genbu*-class Scout (SC)

The previous class of Union scout ship was the *Genbu* class, and it is stil by far the most numerous. Compared with the newer *Cygnus* class, the *Genbu* is slower, sturdier, and smaller in tonnage but larger in usable internal volume. The lenticular main hull is stretched into an oval shape, below which are attached two rectangular Alcubierre drive emitters. The total crew complement is more than double that of the later *Cygnus* class, with much more generous lab space, and a larger shuttle bay.

The *Genbu* class has earned the nickname "the Turtle," which is a pun on the class name, an observation about the oval shape of the ship's hull, an appreciation of the sturdy construction of the ship,  and a derisive description of the ship's performance. With undersized reactionless drives and an Alcubierre drive optimized for reliability rather than performance, early ships in the class, especially the eight vessels in Block I, were noted for their slow speed and awkward handling both above and below lightspeed. Later models added supplementary reactionless drive boosters to the aft ends of the Alcubierre drive nacelles, but the ship's reputation was long since made. 

The *Genbu* class is rapidly being supplanted by the newer *Cygnus* class in front-line Exploration Command service, but not enough newer fast scouts have been constructed yet, and most exploration squadrons still contain at least one older *Genbu*. The larger lab space and crew complement make the *Genbu* a handy alternative to a dedicated sublight lab ship, and the class is likely to continue to soldier on for decades.

#### *Cygnus*-class Scout (SF)

The *Cygnus*-class fast scout is the 

#### *Branbrambog*-class Patrol Cutter (PC)

Informally known as the 

#### *Rohini*-class Patrol Frigate (PS)

With the new *Cygnus*-class fast scouts entering service in
Exploration Command, 

#### *Glidwarg*-class Destroyer (DD)

Informally known as the *Adjective* class, the *Glidwarg*-class Destroyer is currently the only pure combat ship fielded by the Stellar Union. A Kwom design, she shares the "horseshoe crab" 

#### *Excalibur*-class Light Cruiser (CL)

Only a single example of the *Excalibur*-class light cruiser has been constructed as of season 1 (as far as most of the Union knows), as a proof of concept of the design. The ship is a lightly modified version of the *Eratosthanes*-class fleet tug, with a permanently installed "Atlatl" torpedo pod installed in place of the tug's pod grapple. 

#### *Argo Navis*-class Cruiser (CA)
#### *Amundsen*-class Exploration Cruiser (CN)
#### *Eratosthanes*-class Fleet Tug (AT)
#### *North America*-class Monitor (TB)
#### *Admiral Vordrek*-class Tender (TO)
#### *Calypso*-class Research Vessel (TS)
#### *Mauretania*-class Personnel Transport (TT)
#### *Union*-class "New Technology Destroyer" (dreadnought) (DN)
