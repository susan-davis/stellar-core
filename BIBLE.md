# *Stellar Union* series bible

The *Stellar Union* universe is an optimistic future history inspired
by *Star Trek*, *Galaxy Quest*, *The Orville*,  the classic mainframe
`STARTREK` game from the 1970s, the 8-bit microcomputer *Star Fleet*
series of games, the Infocom classic games *Planetfall* and
*Stationfall*, and similar fare. Intrepid, multicultural explorers
from Earth (with a few token aliens sprinkled in the crew to make the
cast seem more diverse) boldly go where angels fear to tread, bringing
the hegemonic values of the civilized Union to the backward natives of
primitive worlds and barbaric empires, while paternalistically
declining to "meddle" in their affairs "for their own good." 

## The *Stellar Union* Universe

*Stellar Union* takes place in the 2270s. Earth has formed a Stellar
 Union of Earth, its colonies, and several alien races.  

### Technology
Technology in the 2270s follows all the tropes of the source material,
taking a cheerfully handwave-y attitude to science fiction.   

#### Starship Technology
Warp-powered starships, with decks parallel to the direction of
travel, ply the ocean of space, but always seem to be aligned on a
common up and down direction when they meet. Ships are powered by
Applied Phlebotinum ("Energon crystals"), and attack and defend with
beams and fields of energy. Ships have energy projectors, an
assortment of missiles and torpedoes, deflector shields, and warp
("Alcubierre") and impulse ("reaction") engines. Ships are equipped
with tractor beams, transporters ("matter transport beams"), and
shuttlecraft.

### The Quellan Empire
The Quellans are an expansionist empire of Proud Warrior Race Guys. The

#### Quellan Ranks
The Quellan rank system spans both military and civil society. Indeed, the
concept of a strict division between the two is foreign to Quellan culture.

- Rank 1: Warrior, Herder, Healer, Smith, Hand Weapon
- Rank 2: Leader, Herd Keeper, Ear
- Rank 3: Raid Leader, Crew Leader, Eye
- Rank 4: Battle Leader, Ship Leader, Tribe Leader, Fortress Keeper, Hand
- Rank 5: War Leader, Horde Leader, Mouth
- Rank 6: reserved for members of the Imperial Family

The Quellans lack the distinction between "enlisted" and "officer"
found in other major powers. Rank 1 could be said to roughly
correspond to the responsibilities of junior enlisted, rank 2 to NCOs,
rank 3 to junior officers, and so forth, but there is no barrier to
advancement from rank 2 to rank 3, and no separate recruiting pipeline
that moves trainees from a cadet status to rank 3. 

Quellan ranks are divided into sub-ranks, each with its own
modifier prefix. Sub-rank -1 takes the prefix "Second", sub-rank 0
takes no prefix, sub-rank +1 takes the prefix "Senior", and sub-rank
+2 takes the prefix "Grand." ("Second Supreme" and "Supreme" are
sub-ranks +3 and +4 respectively, but are restricted in the number of
Quellans who can hold that sub-rank.) Generally, the "Second" sub-rank
is used for second-in-command figures at each command level, and for
trainees earmarked to take on a new position, with "Second Warrior"
being the Quellan term for a cadet or recruit.

Sub-ranks have a second function: they qualify Quellans for membership
in the Senior Council, Grand Council, and Supreme Council,
respectively. These councils advise senior leadership at various
levels of the empire, and confer additional social status. Promotion
to "Second" of a higher rank requires a Quellan to forgo their council
membership earned from their lower rank, and many Quellans decline
promotion for this reason. That has the effect of creating a whole
stratum of Grand Warriors and Grand Leaders in the Quellan military,
equivalent to long-service career NCOs from other galactic powers.

"Hand Weapon," "Ear," "Eye," "Hand," and "Mouth" are special religious
ranks, whose holders act in both religious and police functions. The
ranks always refer to a specific Quellan deity, generally either
Quelil or Gronkadonk, but occasionally to a minor deity.
